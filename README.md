[The Wes Project][wes] is about editing animations used in
[the jMonkeyEngine (JME) game engine][jme].

It contains 2 subprojects:

1. WesLibrary: the Wes [JVM] runtime library
2. WesExamples: demos, examples, and non-automated test software

Complete source code (in [Java]) is provided under

## Important features

+ extract a time-range from an animation
+ resample an animation track at a new frame rate
+ retarget animations from one model/skeleton to another
+ interpolate between keyframes using a wide assortment of algorithms
+ reverse an animation track
+ chain 2 tracks together

## How to add Wes to an existing project

Wes comes pre-built as a single library depends on
[the Heart Library][heart], which in turn depends on
the standard "jme3-core" library from jMonkeyEngine.
Adding Wes to an existing [jMonkeyEngine][jme] project should be
a simple matter of adding these libraries to the classpath.

For projects built using [Maven] or [Gradle], it is sufficient to add a
dependency on the Wes Library.
The build tool should automatically resolve the remaining dependencies.

### Gradle-built projects

Add to the project’s "build.gradle" file:

    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.stephengold:Wes:0.8.1'
    }

For some older versions of Gradle,
it's necessary to replace `implementation` with `compile`.

### Maven-built projects

Add to the project’s "pom.xml" file:

    <repositories>
      <repository>
        <id>mvnrepository</id>
        <url>https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.github.stephengold</groupId>
      <artifactId>Wes</artifactId>
      <version>0.8.1</version>
    </dependency>

### Ant-built projects

For projects built using [Ant], download the Wes and [Heart]
libraries from GitHub:

+ https://github.com/stephengold/Wes/releases/tag/latest
+ https://github.com/stephengold/Heart/releases/tag/8.8.0

You'll definitely want both class jars
and probably the "-sources" and "-javadoc" jars as well.

Open the project's properties in the IDE (JME SDK or NetBeans):

1. Right-click on the project (not its assets) in the "Projects" window.
2. Select "Properties" to open the "Project Properties" dialog.
3. Under "Categories:" select "Libraries".
4. Click on the "Compile" tab.
5. Add the [Heart] class jar:
  + Click on the "Add JAR/Folder" button.
  + Navigate to the download folder.
  + Select the "Heart-8.8.0.jar" file.
  + Click on the "Open" button.
6. (optional) Add jars for javadoc and sources:
  + Click on the "Edit" button.
  + Click on the "Browse..." button to the right of "Javadoc:"
  + Select the "Heart-8.8.0-javadoc.jar" file.
  + Click on the "Open" button.
  + Click on the "Browse..." button to the right of "Sources:"
  + Select the "Heart-8.8.0-sources.jar" file.
  + Click on the "Open" button again.
  + Click on the "OK" button to close the "Edit Jar Reference" dialog.
7. Similarly, add the Wes jar(s).
8. Click on the "OK" button to exit the "Project Properties" dialog.

<a name="build"></a>

## How to build Wes from source

1. Install a [Java Development Kit (JDK)][adoptium],
   if you don't already have one.
2. Point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to your JDK installation:
   (In other words, set it to the path of a directory/folder
   containing a "bin" that contains a Java executable.
   That path might look something like
   "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.3.7-hotspot"
   or "/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/" or
   "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/zulu-17.jdk/Contents/Home" .)
  + using Bash or Zsh: `export JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
  + using [Fish]: `set -g JAVA_HOME "` *path to installation* `"`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `set JAVA_HOME="` *path to installation* `"`
  + using PowerShell: `$env:JAVA_HOME = '` *path to installation* `'`
3. Download and extract the Wes source code from GitHub:
  + using [Git]:
    + `git clone https://github.com/stephengold/Wes.git`
    + `cd Wes`
    + `git checkout -b latest 0.8.1`
  + using a web browser:
    + browse to [the latest release][latest]
    + follow the "Source code (zip)" link
    + save the ZIP file
    + extract the contents of the saved ZIP file
    + `cd` to the extracted directory/folder
4. Run the [Gradle] wrapper:
  + using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew build`
  + using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew build`

After a successful build,
Maven artifacts will be found in "WesLibrary/build/libs".

You can install the artifacts to your local Maven repository:
+ using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew install`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew install`

You can restore the project to a pristine state:
+ using Bash or Fish or PowerShell or Zsh: `./gradlew clean`
+ using Windows Command Prompt: `.\gradlew clean`

<a name="demos"></a>

## An overview of the demo applications

Applications have been created to showcase
certain features of Wes.
The following demos are found in the WesExamples subproject:

### ConvertToInPlace

Demonstrates converting the "hurricane_kick" animation
(from Adi Barda's ninja-fighter model) to an in-place cyclic animation.
The unmodified animation is shown on a white skeleton,
synchronized with the converted animation, which is shown on a yellow skeleton.

### FlashMobDemo

Demonstrates retargeting the "Dance" animation clip of the Sinbad model
to 4 unrelated models: Jaime, MhGame, Oto, and Puppet.

### ReverseAnimation

Demonstrates reversing the "StandUpBack" animation clip of the Sinbad model to
generate a "LieDown" clip.

### TrimAnimation

Demonstrates trimming and stretching the "SliceHorizontal" animation clip of
the Sinbad model to generate a "warn" clip.

<a name="history"></a>

## History

The evolution of this project is chronicled in
[its release log][log].

Much of the Wes code was originally developed for the [Maud editor][maud].

The retargeting code is derived from [the Bvhretarget Project][bvhretarget].

From September 2017 to January 2019, Wes was a subproject of
[the Jme3-utilities Project][utilities].

Since January 2019, Wes has been a separate project, hosted at
[GitHub][wes].
